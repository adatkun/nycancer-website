                        <h2>Understanding Financial Toxicity</h2>
                        <p>Financial toxicity refers to the financial burden and distress that patients may experience as a result of cancer care costs. This can include direct medical expenses, insurance deductibles and co-pays, as well as indirect costs such as loss of income, transportation expenses, and childcare needs. We recognize that financial concerns can significantly impact your quality of life and even influence treatment decisions.</p>
                        <p>Our Financial Counseling team is committed to helping you minimize financial toxicity through proactive planning, education about insurance coverage, and connection to assistance programs. By addressing these concerns early in your treatment journey, we aim to reduce stress and enable you to focus on your health.</p>
