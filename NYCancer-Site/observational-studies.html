                            <p>Observational studies are a vital type of research that helps us better understand cancer and blood disorders without directly intervening in patient care. Unlike interventional clinical trials that test new treatments, observational studies collect data on patients receiving standard care to answer important questions about disease patterns, outcomes, and quality of life.</p>
                            <p>These studies provide valuable insights into real-world experiences and long-term outcomes that complement the information gained from traditional clinical trials. By participating in observational research, patients contribute to medical knowledge while maintaining their current treatment plans.</p>
