Medical oncologists are physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using these systemic therapies.</p>
                        <p>Our medical oncologists serve as your primary cancer physician, coordinating your overall care and working closely with other specialists to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific cancer type, stage, genetic profile, and individual needs.</p>
                        <p>Medical oncology treatments include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> - Powerful medications that kill rapidly dividing cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Immunotherapy</strong> - Treatments that harness the body's immune system to fight cancer</li>
                            <li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> - Drugs that target specific genetic changes in cancer cells</li>
