<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Medical Oncology?</h2>
                        <p>Medical oncology is a subspecialty of internal medicine that focuses on treating cancer with medications that travel through the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Medical oncologists are physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using these systemic therapies.</p>
                        <p>Our medical oncologists serve as your primary cancer physician, coordinating your overall care and working closely with other specialists to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific cancer type, stage, genetic profile, and individual needs.</p>
                        <p>Medical oncology treatments include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> - Powerful medications that kill rapidly dividing cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Immunotherapy</strong> - Treatments that harness the body's immune system to fight cancer</li>
                            <li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> - Drugs that target specific genetic changes in cancer cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormone therapy</strong> - Treatments that block cancer-promoting hormones</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological therapy</strong> - Substances derived from living organisms to treat cancer</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical trials</strong> - Access to innovative investigational treatments</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Treatment Options -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Medical Oncology Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>Our medical oncologists have expertise in all standard cancer treatments as well as the latest advances in cancer care. Your personalized treatment plan may include one or more of the following approaches:</p>
                
                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                <p>Chemotherapy uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing and dividing. It may be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the primary treatment for certain cancers</li>
                    <li>Before surgery (neoadjuvant) to shrink tumors</li>
                    <li>After surgery (adjuvant) to kill any remaining cancer cells</li>
                    <li>In combination with other treatments like radiation or immunotherapy</li>
                    <li>To manage symptoms and improve quality of life in advanced cancer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We offer the latest chemotherapy agents and combinations, delivered with meticulous attention to dosing and scheduling to maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects.</p>
                
                <h3>Hormone Therapy</h3>
                <p>For hormone-sensitive cancers like certain breast and prostate cancers, hormone therapy can be highly effective. These treatments work by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blocking the body's ability to produce certain hormones</li>
                    <li>Interfering with how hormones behave in the body</li>
                    <li>Preventing hormone receptors on cancer cells from binding with circulating hormones</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
                <p>Immunotherapy harnesses the power of your own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Types include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checkpoint inhibitors that remove the "brakes" on immune responses</li>
                    <li>Cytokines that boost immune system activity</li>
                    <li>Cancer vaccines that teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells</li>
                    <li>CAR T-cell therapy where immune cells are modified to better target cancer</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Targeted Therapy</h3>
                <p>These newer drugs target specific genetic mutations or proteins involved in cancer growth, offering more precise treatment with often fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. Options include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small-molecule inhibitors that block specific enzymes and proteins</li>
                    <li>Monoclonal antibodies that target specific markers on cancer cells</li>
                    <li>Antibody-drug conjugates that deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells</li>
                    <li>Proteasome inhibitors that interfere with proteins cancer cells need for growth</li>
