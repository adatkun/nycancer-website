<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Chemotherapy?</h2>
                        <p>Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses powerful medications to kill rapidly dividing cells throughout the body. While these drugs primarily target cancer cells, they can also affect some normal cells that divide quickly, which explains many of the side effects associated with treatment.</p>
                        <p>Modern chemotherapy has evolved significantly since its development in the mid-20th century. Today's chemotherapy treatments are more effective, precise, and accompanied by better supportive care to manage side effects. They can be used in various ways to treat cancer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Curative therapy</strong> - To eliminate cancer completely</li>
                            <li><strong>Neoadjuvant therapy</strong> - Given before surgery to shrink tumors</li>
                            <li><strong>Adjuvant therapy</strong> - Given after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Palliative therapy</strong> - To reduce symptoms and improve quality of life</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintenance therapy</strong> - To prevent or delay cancer recurrence</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

<!-- Types of Chemotherapy -->
                <h2>Types of Chemotherapy</h2>
                <p>At New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we use various chemotherapy agents, often in combinations tailored to your specific cancer type and individual factors. Major classes include:</p>
                
                <h3>Alkylating Agents</h3>
                <p>These drugs damage DNA to prevent cancer cells from reproducing. They're commonly used for a wide range of cancers including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lymphomas and some leukemias</li>
                    <li>Multiple myeloma</li>
                    <li>Sarcoma</li>
                    <li>Lung, breast, and ovarian cancers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples include cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin.</p>
                
                <h3>Antimetabolites</h3>
                <p>These drugs interfere with DNA and RNA growth by substituting for the normal building blocks of RNA and DNA. They're particularly effective for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leukemias and lymphomas</li>
                    <li>Breast, ovarian, and intestinal tract cancers</li>
                    <li>Some other solid tumors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.</p>
                
                <h3>Anti-tumor Antibiotics</h3>
                <p>These medications, different from antibiotics used for infections, interfere with enzymes involved in DNA replication. They're used for various cancers, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breast cancer</li>
                    <li>Lymphomas</li>
                    <li>Sarcomas</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples include doxorubicin, epirubicin, and mitoxantrone.</p>
                
                <h3>Topoisomerase Inhibitors</h3>
                <p>These drugs interfere with enzymes called topoisomerases, which help separate the strands of DNA for replication. They're effective for treating:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain leukemias</li>
                    <li>Lung, ovarian, and gastrointestinal cancers</li>
                    <li>Some other cancer types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples include irinotecan, topotecan, and etoposide.</p>
                
                <h3>Mitotic Inhibitors</h3>
                <p>These medications, many derived from natural sources like plants, stop cells from dividing by interfering with microtubules. They're commonly used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breast and lung cancers</li>
                    <li>Myelomas</li>
                    <li>Lymphomas</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples include paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinblastine, and vincristine.</p>
                
                <h3>Targeted Therapy Agents</h3>
                <p>While distinct from traditional chemotherapy, many targeted agents are used alongside or as alternatives to conventional chemotherapy. These medications specifically target genetic features of cancer cells with often fewer side effects.</p>
