                        <h2>Understanding Blood Clotting Disorders</h2>
                        <p>Blood clotting (coagulation) is a normal process that helps stop bleeding when you're injured. However, in blood clotting disorders, this process occurs inappropriately or excessively, forming clots that can block blood vessels and potentially cause serious health problems.</p>
                        <p>Blood clotting disorders can be inherited (genetic) or acquired (developing later in life due to other conditions or factors). Common types include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Factor V Leiden</strong> - The most common inherited thrombophilia in the U.S.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prothrombin gene mutation</strong> - A genetic variant that increases clotting risk</li>
                            <li><strong>Protein C deficiency</strong> - Lack of a protein that helps regulate clotting</li>
                            <li><strong>Protein S deficiency</strong> - Deficiency in another natural anticoagulant</li>
                            <li><strong>Antithrombin deficiency</strong> - Reduced levels of a protein that inhibits clot formation</li>
                            <li><strong>Antiphospholipid syndrome</strong> - An autoimmune disorder that targets phospholipid-binding proteins</li>
                            <li><strong>Hyperhomocysteinemia</strong> - Elevated levels of the amino acid homocysteine</li>
                            <li><strong>Acquired thrombophilia</strong> - Due to cancer, surgery, pregnancy, hormone therapy, or other factors</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Clinical Manifestations -->
                <h2>Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Blood clotting disorders often manifest as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</strong> - Blood clots typically in the legs, causing pain, swelling, and redness</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</strong> - Blood clots that travel to the lungs, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening complications</li>
                    <li><strong>Cerebral venous thrombosis</strong> - Clots in the brain's venous sinuses</li>
                    <li><strong>Portal vein thrombosis</strong> - Clots in the vein that carries blood from the intestines to the liver</li>
                    <li><strong>Recurrent miscarriage</strong> - Some clotting disorders increase the risk of pregnancy loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Arterial thrombosis</strong> - Less common in most thrombophilias, but can occur</li>
                    <li><strong>Unusual clots</strong> - Clots in unusual locations or occurring without typical risk factors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our advanced diagnostic approach includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive medical history</strong> - Review of personal and family history of clots</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical examination</strong> - To identify signs of clotting</li>
                    <li><strong>Imaging studies</strong> - Ultrasound, CT scans, MRIs to detect existing clots</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood tests</strong> - For specific clotting factors and genetic mutations</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic testing</strong> - To identify inherited thrombophilias</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized coagulation tests</strong> - To assess the blood's clotting ability</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Treatment Options for Blood Clotting Disorders</h2>
                <p>Treatment for blood clotting disorders focuses on preventing clot formation, treating existing clots, and managing underlying conditions. Your personalized treatment plan may include:</p>
