<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Mammography?</h2>
                        <p>Mammography is a specialized medical imaging technique that uses a low-dose X-ray system to examine breast tissue. It is the most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages—often before physical symptoms develop or lumps can be felt.</p>
                        <p>At New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we exclusively offer 3D mammography (tomosynthesis), the most advanced technology available. 3D mammography creates multiple images or "slices" that allow our radiologists to examine breast tissue layer by layer, providing greater clarity and detail compared to traditional 2D mammography.</p>
                        <p>The benefits of 3D mammography include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Improved cancer detection rates</strong>, particularly in women with dense breast tissue</li>
                            <li><strong>Fewer false positives</strong>, reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety</li>
                            <li><strong>Better visualization</strong> of the breast, especially for women with dense breast tissue</li>
                            <li><strong>Greater accuracy</strong> in pinpointing size, shape, and location of abnormalities</li>
                            <li><strong>Similar X-ray dose</strong> to standard 2D mammography when used with software that creates both 2D and 3D images</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Screening Guidelines -->
                <h2>Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines</h2>
                <p>Early detection is key to successful breast cancer treatment. While specific recommendations may vary based on your individual risk factors, general guidelines include:</p>
                
                <h3>For Women at Average Risk:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ages 40-44:</strong> Annual mammograms are optional but should be discussed with your healthcare provider</li>
                    <li><strong>Ages 45-54:</strong> Annual mammograms are recommended</li>
                    <li><strong>Ages 55 and older:</strong> Mammograms every 1-2 years, or continuing yearly screening based on personal preference and provider recommendation</li>
                    <li><strong>Screening should continue</strong> as long as a woman is in good health and has a life expectancy of at least 10 years</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>For Women at Higher Risk:</h3>
                <p>You may need to begin screening earlier, have additional tests, or be screened more often if you have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal history of breast cancer</li>
                    <li>A family history of breast cancer, particularly in a first-degree relative</li>
                    <li>A known genetic mutation (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2)</li>
                    <li>Previous chest radiation therapy before age 30</li>
                    <li>Certain benign breast conditions</li>
                    <li>Dense breast tissue</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Our specialists will work with you to develop a personalized screening plan based on your individual risk factors, family history, and personal preferences.</p>

<!-- The Mammography Experience -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What to Expect During Your Mammogram</h2>
                <p>We understand that mammograms can cause anxiety for many women. At New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we've designed our mammography experience to be as comfortable, efficient, and stress-free as possible:</p>
                
                <h3>Before Your Appointment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> We offer flexible appointment times, including early mornings, evenings, and select weekend hours at some locations</li>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> On the day of your exam, please do not use deodorant, antiperspirant, powder, lotion, or perfume under your arms or on your breasts, as these can appear as white spots on the X-ray</li>
                    <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Wear a two-piece outfit, as you'll need to undress from the waist up</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> If you have not gone through menopause, try to schedule your mammogram for the week after your period, when breasts are typically less tender</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>During Your Mammogram</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check-in:</strong> Our friendly staff will guide you through registration and paperwork</li>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> You'll change into a gown and be escorted to the mammography suite</li>
                    <li><strong>The procedure:</strong> Our experienced technologist will position your breast on the mammography machine. The breast is compressed between two plates to spread the tissue and minimize radiation exposure while getting the clearest image possible</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple images:</strong> For a complete screening, several images of each breast will be taken from different angles</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The actual examination takes only about 15-20 minutes, though compression lasts just a few seconds for each image</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>After Your Mammogram</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expert review:</strong> A board-certified radiologist specializing in breast imaging will interpret your mammogram</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid results:</strong> Most screening results are available within 1-2 business days</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy access:</strong> Results are securely delivered through our patient portal and sent to your referring physician</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> If additional imaging is recommended, our team will contact you promptly to schedule any necessary appointments</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Comfort Measures</h3>
                <p>We understand that breast compression can be uncomfortable. Our mammography team uses several approaches to minimize discomfort:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MammoPad® cushioning for softer compression</li>
                    <li>Experienced technologists trained in positioning techniques that minimize discomfort</li>
                    <li>Short compression times due to our advanced equipment</li>

Scheduling your mammogram after your menstrual period, when breasts are typically less tender, can also help reduce discomfort.</p>

                        <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between 2D and 3D mammography?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Traditional 2D mammography takes two flat images of each breast, from top-to-bottom and side-to-side. 3D mammography (tomosynthesis) takes multiple images from different angles and creates a three-dimensional picture of the breast. This allows radiologists to examine breast tissue layer by layer, which improves cancer detection and reduces false positives, particularly for women with dense breast tissue.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Mammograms use very low doses of radiation. The benefits of early detection far outweigh any potential risks from this minimal radiation exposure. Our equipment is regularly tested and calibrated to ensure the lowest possible dose while maintaining image quality. For perspective, the radiation from a mammogram is roughly equivalent to the amount of radiation a person normally receives from their natural surroundings over about seven weeks.</p>

                            <p>Women with breast implants should still get regular mammograms. When scheduling, be sure to inform us that you have implants so we can plan accordingly. Our technologists are experienced in specialized techniques for imaging breasts with implants, which typically involve taking additional images with the implants displaced (pushed back) to better visualize the breast tissue.</p>

                            <p>A callback after a screening mammogram means that the radiologist has identified an area that needs additional evaluation. This is relatively common and does NOT necessarily mean you have cancer. About 10% of women are called back for additional imaging, and the vast majority do not have cancer. Additional imaging might include special mammogram views, ultrasound, or rarely, MRI. Our team will guide you through any additional testing needed.</p>

                            <p>Current guidelines generally recommend annual mammograms beginning at age 40, though this may vary based on your personal risk factors. Women aged 55 and older may transition to mammograms every two years, or they may choose to continue annual screening. Women with certain risk factors may need to begin screening earlier or have additional tests beyond mammography. We recommend discussing your personal screening schedule with your healthcare provider.</p>
