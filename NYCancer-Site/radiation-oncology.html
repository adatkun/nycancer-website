<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Radiation Oncology?</h2>
                        <p>Radiation oncology uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells. Radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, which prevents them from dividing and growing. While radiation can also affect nearby healthy cells, advanced techniques allow us to precisely target cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue.</p>
                        <p>Our radiation oncology department is led by board-certified radiation oncologists who work closely with medical physicists, dosimetrists, radiation therapists, and specialized nurses to deliver safe, effective radiation treatments tailored to each patient's specific condition.</p>
                        <p>Radiation therapy may be used:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As the primary treatment for certain cancers</li>
                            <li>In combination with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other treatments</li>
                            <li>Before surgery to shrink tumors (neoadjuvant therapy)</li>
                            <li>After surgery to eliminate remaining cancer cells (adjuvant therapy)</li>
                            <li>To relieve symptoms in advanced cancer (palliative therapy)</li>
                            <li>For certain non-cancerous conditions</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Advanced Technologies -->
                <h2>Advanced Radiation Technologies</h2>
                <p>New York Cancer & Blood Specialists offers the most advanced radiation therapy technologies available, allowing our team to deliver precise treatment with maximum effectiveness and minimal side effects:</p>
                
                <h3>External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3D Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT)</strong> - Uses CT scans and special computers to precisely map the location of a tumor in three dimensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)</strong> - An advanced form of 3D-CRT that allows for the radiation dose to conform more precisely to the three-dimensional shape of the tumor by modulating the intensity of the radiation beam</li>
                    <li><strong>Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)</strong> - Uses imaging during treatment to ensure precise targeting of the tumor, even if its position changes slightly</li>
                    <li><strong>Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)</strong> - A specialized form of IMRT that delivers radiation continuously as the machine rotates around the patient, reducing treatment time</li>
                    <li><strong>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)</strong> - Delivers extremely precise, very high doses of radiation to tumors while minimizing damage to healthy tissue, completed in fewer treatments</li>
                    <li><strong>Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)</strong> - Delivers precisely-targeted radiation at much higher doses in only a single or few treatments, mostly used for brain or spinal tumors</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Brachytherapy</h3>
                <p>Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources directly into or near the tumor site. This allows for high doses of radiation to be delivered to the tumor while reducing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. We offer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy</strong> - Temporary placement of radioactive sources for minutes at a time</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Dose Rate (LDR) Brachytherapy</strong> - Permanent placement of radioactive "seeds" that deliver radiation over time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Specialized Radiation Treatments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT)</strong> - Radiation delivered directly to the tumor site during surgery</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Body Irradiation (TBI)</strong> - Radiation treatment to the entire body, often used before bone marrow transplantation</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiopharmaceuticals</strong> - Radioactive substances that are injected into the body and target specific cancer cells</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment Planning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simulation session</strong> - A planning appointment using CT scans or other imaging to map your treatment area</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom immobilization devices</strong> created to ensure you remain in the exact same position for each treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment plan design</strong> by your radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and dosimetrist</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan verification</strong> through quality assurance procedures</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular appointments</strong> after treatment completion to monitor your recovery and response</li>
                    <li><strong>Management of any late side effects</strong> of radiation</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordination with your medical oncologist</strong> and other members of your care team</li>
