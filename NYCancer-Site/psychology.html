                        <h2>The Importance of Psychological Support in Cancer Care</h2>
                        <p>Cancer can bring significant emotional and psychological challenges that impact your quality of life and even influence treatment outcomes. Many patients experience anxiety, depression, fear, or difficulties adjusting to the changes that cancer brings to their lives and relationships.</p>
                        <p>At NYCBS, we believe that addressing these psychological aspects is a fundamental part of comprehensive cancer care. Our approach integrates mental health support with your medical treatment, recognizing that emotional well-being is essential for optimal healing and recovery.</p>

                        <p>Feeling down, upset about yourself or your appearance, or experiencing a sense of hopelessness about the future are natural responses to a cancer diagnosis. We provide support and evidence-based interventions to address these feelings.</p>
