                    <p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the United States. At New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we're committed to providing comprehensive prostate cancer screening services that can help detect cancer at its earliest, most treatable stages.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding Prostate Cancer Screening</h2>
                            <p>Prostate cancer screening is a process that checks for signs of cancer before symptoms appear. When detected early, prostate cancer is highly treatable, with excellent survival rates. Our specialists use a combination of methods to screen for prostate cancer, including blood tests and physical examinations.</p>
                            <p>We follow evidence-based guidelines while personalizing recommendations based on your individual risk factors:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Age (risk increases after 50, or earlier with family history)</li>
                                <li>Family history of prostate cancer</li>
                                <li>African American heritage (higher risk group)</li>
                                <li>Previous abnormal screening results</li>
                                <li>Exposure to certain chemicals or radiation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <h2>Screening Methods</h2>
                    <p>We offer several approaches to prostate cancer screening:</p>
                    
                    <h3>PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) Blood Test</h3>
                    <p>This simple blood test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer, though other conditions can also cause elevated PSA. Our specialists interpret your results in context of your overall health and risk factors.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)</h3>
                    <p>During this brief physical exam, a doctor checks for abnormalities in the prostate that might indicate cancer. Though not comfortable, this exam provides valuable information that complements PSA testing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Advanced Screening Options</h3>
                    <p>For patients with elevated risk or previous abnormal results, we offer advanced options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free vs. Total PSA Ratio</strong> - Helps distinguish between cancer and benign conditions</li>
                        <li><strong>PSA Density</strong> - Relates PSA level to prostate size</li>
                        <li><strong>PSA Velocity</strong> - Tracks changes in PSA over time</li>
                        <li><strong>Prostate Health Index (PHI)</strong> - Combines several tests for better accuracy</li>
                        <li><strong>4Kscore Test</strong> - Analyzes multiple markers to assess risk</li>
                        <li><strong>MRI fusion technology</strong> - Provides detailed imaging when needed</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>When To Start Screening</h2>
                    <p>We follow guidelines that recommend discussing prostate cancer screening with your doctor:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Age 40-45:</strong> For men at high risk (African American men and those with a strong family history)</li>
                        <li><strong>Age 50:</strong> For men at average risk</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The decision to screen is personal and should be based on a discussion with your healthcare provider about risks, benefits, and your individual health needs. Our specialists take time to have these important conversations and answer all your questions.</p>
