                        <h2>The Role of Our Benefits Counselors</h2>
                        <p>The role of the oncology benefit counselor is to guide patients who may potentially face financial toxicity when going through the hardship of chemotherapy. Our highly trained counselors will guide patients through the insurance process and obtain any available assistance that may meet their needs.</p>
                        <p>Our benefit counselors will meet one-on-one or with patient's families to educate all parties on their current insurance and the type of coverage it entails. They will review the patient's deductible, out-of-pocket, co-insurance, co-pays, and estimated cost of treatment.</p>

                <h2>Nutritional Counseling Support</h2>
                <p>In addition to benefits counseling, we at New York Cancer and Blood Specialists believe in a multidisciplinary, and holistic approach to cancer treatment. We strongly believe in exercise and proper nutritional counseling during your care with us.</p>
                
                <p>For your benefit, we offer on-site nutritional counseling while you are on treatment. We will have our registered dietitian speak with you at various points during your therapy to make sure we are doing all that we can to help you.</p>
                
                <h3>Nutrition During and After Cancer Treatment</h3>
                <p>The goal of nutrition therapy during and after your treatment is to help you get the nutrients needed to keep up your body weight and strength, keep body tissue healthy, and fight infections.</p>
                
                <p>Eating habits for people with cancer can be different from the usual healthy eating guidelines. Healthy eating habits and good nutrition can help patients deal with the effects of cancer and its treatment.</p>
                
                <h3>What Should I Eat?</h3>
                <p>Patients often have many questions as to what they should or should not eat. Your nutrition evaluation will review a tailored care plan to meet your specific needs and goals, as well as assist with side effects of treatments and address dietary concerns.</p>
                
                <p>Oncology Registered Dieticians can help improve side effects of cancer treatment including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight Loss/Weight Gain</li>

                            <p>We recommend meeting with a benefits counselor as early as possible in your treatment journey, ideally shortly after your diagnosis or when your treatment plan is being developed. This allows time to explore all available options before treatment begins. However, our counselors are available to assist at any point during your care.</p>

                            <p>No, benefits counseling is a complimentary service that we offer to all of our patients. We believe that helping you navigate the financial aspects of your care is an essential part of your overall treatment and support.</p>
