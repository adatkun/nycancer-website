<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Targeted Therapy?</h2>
                        <p>Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that precisely identifies and attacks specific types of cancer cells while causing less harm to normal cells. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which attacks all rapidly dividing cells, targeted therapies interfere with specific molecules involved in cancer growth, progression, and spread.</p>
                        <p>These treatments work by targeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Specific genetic mutations</strong> that drive cancer growth</li>
                            <li><strong>Proteins</strong> that are overexpressed on cancer cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Signaling pathways</strong> that cancer cells use to grow and survive</li>
                            <li><strong>The tumor microenvironment</strong> that supports cancer development</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood vessel formation</strong> that supplies tumors with nutrients</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By focusing on these specific targets, these medications can block cancer growth and spread while typically causing fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapy. Targeted therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling more personalized approaches based on the unique characteristics of each patient's cancer.</p>

<!-- Types of Targeted Therapy -->
                <h2>Types of Targeted Therapy</h2>
                <p>New York Cancer & Blood Specialists offers a comprehensive range of targeted therapies, addressing various cellular mechanisms that drive cancer growth:</p>
                
                <h3>Small Molecule Inhibitors</h3>
                <p>These drugs are small enough to enter cancer cells and interfere with specific molecules involved in tumor growth and spread. Major categories include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)</strong> - Block enzymes called tyrosine kinases that are crucial for cell signaling pathways

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>mTOR inhibitors</strong> (e.g., everolimus, temsirolimus) - Block a protein that regulates cell growth and survival</li>
                    <li><strong>PARP inhibitors</strong> (e.g., olaparib, niraparib) - Prevent cancer cells from repairing their DNA, leading to cell death</li>
                    <li><strong>CDK4/6 inhibitors</strong> (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib) - Block proteins involved in cell division</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Monoclonal Antibodies</h3>
                <p>These laboratory-made proteins are designed to bind to specific targets on cancer cells. They work in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blocking growth signals</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HER2 antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab) for HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers</li>
                            <li>EGFR antibodies (e.g., cetuximab) for colorectal and head and neck cancers</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Marking cancer cells for immune system attack</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Angiogenesis Inhibitors</h3>
                <p>These drugs block the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow:</p>

                <h3>Hormone Therapies</h3>
                <p>For cancers that are driven by hormones, these targeted approaches either reduce hormone levels or block hormone effects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For breast cancer:</strong> Selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen), aromatase inhibitors (e.g., letrozole), and selective estrogen receptor degraders (e.g., fulvestrant)</li>
                    <li><strong>For prostate cancer:</strong> Anti-androgens (e.g., enzalutamide, apalutamide), androgen synthesis inhibitors (e.g., abiraterone)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Immunomodulatory Drugs</h3>
                <p>These medications adjust immune responses and affect the tumor microenvironment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide for multiple myeloma and certain lymphomas</li>
