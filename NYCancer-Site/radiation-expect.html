<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>What is Radiation Treatment?</h2>
                        <p>Radiation treatment uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Radiation damages cancer cells so they cannot grow or divide. Once they are damaged, they can no longer repair themselves, so they die. Normal cells can continue to repair themselves and heal. The treatment does not cause pain or discomfort and does not make you radioactive.</p>
                        <p>Radiation therapy may be used:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As the primary treatment for certain cancers</li>
                            <li>In combination with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other treatments</li>
                            <li>Before surgery to shrink tumors (neoadjuvant therapy)</li>
                            <li>After surgery to eliminate remaining cancer cells (adjuvant therapy)</li>
                            <li>To relieve symptoms in advanced cancer (palliative therapy)</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Simulation -->
                <h2>What is the Radiation Simulation Appointment?</h2>
                <p>The simulation is a treatment planning session which helps prepare you for your treatment and helps the team generate a formal treatment plan. Radiation therapy requires a simulation to ensure the precise and accurate targeting of tumors, allowing for the delivery of personalized radiation treatment to individual patients.</p>
                <p>The primary objective of simulation is to ensure that you're in the same position during your radiation therapy sessions every day. To achieve this goal, various immobilization tools may be used, tailored to the specific body region undergoing treatment.</p>
                
                <h3>What Should I Expect During Simulation?</h3>
                <p>You will undergo a CT scan under the care of a radiation therapist. While your doctor will oversee all of your care, a radiation therapist specifically trained to prepare and treat patients with radiation will position you for simulation and eventually treatment.</p>
                <p>During your simulation procedure and subsequent treatments, you should remain completely still. The initial step in the CT simulation process involves ensuring your alignment. Laser guides in the room may be used to achieve the correct alignment. Once you are consistently positioned and properly aligned, a CT scan of the treatment area is performed. After your scan, the radiation therapist may mark your skin with a marker and permanent tattoos. The markers are about the size of a freckle (1 mm in diameter). These tattoos serve to ensure consistent positioning during each treatment session.</p>
                <p>After you undergo your simulation scan, you will be given a radiation treatment start date.</p>

<!-- Preparation -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How Do I Prepare for the Simulation Appointment?</h2>
                <p>Depending on the location being treated, there are different steps to prepare for the radiation treatment. If your disease site is not listed below, you likely do not have any specific preparation steps for your treatment. Please speak to your provider to confirm there are no specific preparation instructions.</p>

<!-- Treatment Process -->
                <h2>The Radiation Treatment Process</h2>
                <p>Once your simulation is complete and your treatment plan has been created, you'll begin your radiation therapy sessions. Here's what to expect during the treatment process:</p>
                
                <h3>Before Your First Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Treatment planning</strong> - Our team uses the information gathered during simulation to create a personalized treatment plan</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan review</strong> - Your radiation oncologist reviews and approves the treatment plan</li>
                    <li><strong>Education session</strong> - You'll receive detailed information about your specific treatment and potential side effects</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule coordination</strong> - We'll work with you to create a treatment schedule that fits your needs</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>During Treatment Sessions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily check-in</strong> - You'll check in at reception for each treatment session</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing</strong> - You may need to change into a gown depending on the treatment area</li>
                    <li><strong>Positioning</strong> - The radiation therapists will position you on the treatment table using the same immobilization devices and positioning used during simulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment delivery</strong> - The actual radiation delivery typically takes only a few minutes, though the entire appointment may last 15-30 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular check-ups</strong> - You'll meet with your radiation oncologist weekly to discuss your progress and manage any side effects</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>After Completing Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Follow-up appointments</strong> - Your radiation oncologist will schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor your recovery and treatment response</li>
                    <li><strong>Continued care</strong> - You'll receive information about managing any lingering side effects</li>
                    <li><strong>Survivorship planning</strong> - We provide comprehensive support for life after treatment</li>
                </ul>

<!-- Managing Side Effects -->
                <h2>Managing Side Effects</h2>
                <p>Radiation therapy affects everyone differently. Side effects depend on the area being treated, the dose of radiation, and your overall health. Our team will help you manage any side effects that may occur during or after your treatment.</p>

                    <li><strong>Skin changes</strong> - Redness, irritation, or dryness in the treatment area</li>
                    <li><strong>Site-specific effects</strong> - Depending on the area being treated (e.g., dry mouth for head and neck radiation, digestive issues for abdominal radiation)</li>
                </ul>

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none;">
                            <p>No, you will not feel any pain or discomfort during the radiation treatment itself. The radiation beams are not felt as they pass through your body. However, some patients may experience side effects like skin irritation or fatigue as treatment progresses. Our team will help you manage any side effects that occur.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none;">
                            <p>No, external beam radiation therapy does not make you radioactive. The radiation passes through your body during treatment but does not remain afterward. You can safely be around other people, including children and pregnant women, immediately after each treatment session.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none;">
                            <p>Most radiation therapy sessions last about 15-30 minutes total, with the actual radiation delivery taking only a few minutes. The rest of the time is spent positioning you correctly and setting up the equipment. The first session may take longer as extra checks are performed.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none;">
                            <p>The number of treatment sessions varies depending on your type of cancer, its stage, and your overall treatment plan. Some treatments may be completed in a single session or a few sessions (like stereotactic radiosurgery), while others might require daily treatments for 2-9 weeks. Your radiation oncologist will discuss your specific treatment schedule during your consultation.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none;">
                            <p>Most patients can drive themselves to and from radiation treatments, as the procedure itself does not impair your ability to drive. However, if you experience fatigue or are taking medications that could affect driving, you might want to arrange for transportation. Some patients also find it helpful to have someone accompany them to the first few appointments.</p>

                            <p>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes that provide easy access to the treatment area. Depending on the area being treated, you may be asked to change into a hospital gown. Avoid wearing jewelry, metal objects, or clothing with metal components (like zippers or underwire bras) in the treatment area. Our team will provide specific guidance based on your treatment plan.</p>
