<!-- Understanding -->
                        <h2>Understanding Anemia</h2>
                        <p>Anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough red blood cells or when these cells don't function properly. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that enables them to carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Without sufficient healthy red blood cells, your tissues and organs don't get enough oxygen to function properly.</p>
                        <p>Different types of anemia include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Iron deficiency anemia</strong> - The most common type, caused by insufficient iron</li>
                            <li><strong>Vitamin deficiency anemia</strong> - Resulting from low levels of vitamin B12 or folate</li>
                            <li><strong>Anemia of chronic disease</strong> - Associated with chronic conditions like cancer or kidney disease</li>
                            <li><strong>Aplastic anemia</strong> - When your body stops producing enough new blood cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Hemolytic anemia</strong> - When red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced</li>
                            <li><strong>Sickle cell anemia</strong> - An inherited form where red blood cells are shaped like sickles</li>
                            <li><strong>Thalassemia</strong> - Inherited blood disorders that affect hemoglobin production</li>
                        </ul>

<!-- Symptoms -->
                <h2>Symptoms and Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>The symptoms of anemia can vary depending on the cause and severity but often include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fatigue and weakness</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Pale or yellowish skin</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Irregular heartbeat</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Shortness of breath</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Dizziness or lightheadedness</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Chest pain</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cold hands and feet</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Headaches</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our specialists use comprehensive diagnostic testing to identify the type and cause of anemia, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete blood count (CBC)</strong> - Measures the levels of red cells, white cells, and platelets</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripheral blood smear</strong> - Examines the size, shape, and appearance of blood cells</li>
                    <li><strong>Iron studies</strong> - Measure iron levels and how it's stored and used in your body</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamin B12 and folate tests</strong> - Check for deficiencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Reticulocyte count</strong> - Measures new red blood cells in your blood</li>
                    <li><strong>Hemoglobin electrophoresis</strong> - Identifies abnormal forms of hemoglobin</li>
                    <li><strong>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</strong> - Examines bone marrow function when necessary</li>
                </ul>
