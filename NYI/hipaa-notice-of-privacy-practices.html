          <p>We understand that your medical information is private and confidential. Further, we are required by law to maintain the privacy of "protected health information." "Protected health information" or "PHI" includes any individually identifiable information that we obtain from you or others that relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health, the health care you have received, or payment for your health care.</p>
          <p>As necessary, we will share protected health information with one another to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations relating to the imaging services to be rendered and/or any entity under the New York Imaging Specialists network.</p>
          <p>As required by law, this notice provides you with information about your rights and our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to the privacy of PHI. This notice also discusses the uses and disclosures we will make of your PHI. We must comply with the provisions of this notice as currently in effect, although we reserve the right to change the terms of this notice from time to time and to make the revised notice effective for all PHI we maintain.</p>
          <div class="info-callout">

        <div class="legal-section" id="permitted-uses">
          <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Permitted Uses and Disclosures</h2>
          <p>We can use or disclose your PHI for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations. We have provided a description and an example for each of these uses and disclosures below. However, not every particular use or disclosure in every category will be listed.</p>

          <div class="use-category">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-stethoscope"></i> Treatment</h3>
            <p>Treatment means the provision, coordination, or management of your health care, including consultations between health care providers relating to your care and referrals for health care from one health care provider to another.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Example:</strong> A doctor treating you may need to share your imaging results with a specialist to determine the appropriate course of treatment. Your radiologist may need to consult with your referring physician about findings from your MRI, CT, or other imaging study.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="use-category">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-credit-card"></i> Payment</h3>
            <p>Payment means the activities we undertake to obtain reimbursement for the health care provided to you, including billing, collections, claims management, determination of eligibility and coverage, and other utilization review activities.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Example:</strong> We may need to provide PHI to your insurance company to determine whether the proposed imaging procedure will be covered. When we subsequently bill the insurance company for the services rendered to you, we can provide them with information regarding your care if necessary to obtain payment.
            </div>
            <p>Federal or State law may require us to obtain a written release from you before disclosing certain specially protected PHI for payment purposes. We will ask you to sign a release when necessary under applicable law.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="use-category">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Health Care Operations</h3>
            <p>Health care operations mean the support functions of New York Imaging Specialists related to treatment and payment, such as quality assurance activities, case management, receiving and responding to patient comments and complaints, physician reviews, compliance programs, audits, business planning, development, management, and administrative activities.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
              <strong>Example:</strong> We may use your PHI to evaluate the performance of our radiologists and imaging technologists when caring for you. We may also combine PHI from many patients to decide what additional imaging services we should offer, assess image quality, and evaluate the effectiveness of new imaging technologies.
            </div>
            <p>We may also remove information that identifies you so that others can use the de-identified information to study health care and health care delivery without learning who you are.</p>
